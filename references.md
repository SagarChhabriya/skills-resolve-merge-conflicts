### :keyboard: Activity: Create your own conflict

We went ahead and added a new file called `references.md` and pushed that change to `main`, without updating your `my-resume` branch.

1. Browse to the `my-resume` branch.
1. Click the `Add file` dropdown menu and then on `Create new file`.
1. Create a file named `references.md`.
1. Enter some text that conflicts with what we added for `references.md` in the `main` branch.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter a commit message for your change.
1. Click the **Commit new file** button, making sure the "Commit directly to the `my-resume` branch" option is selected.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
